# Requirements
## wxWidgets library 

# Start Debugger
In the “config.txt” file you must specify the paths to the input and output files.
After this we can start the debugger.
If we have problems starting the debugger, look for the error in the "log.txt" file.
## Config:
Example: 
```
InputFILE=C:\...\in.txt 
OutputFILE=C:\...\out.txt
```
